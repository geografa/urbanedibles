When I went today, no one was home, so I don't know if the same couple lives there, or if someone new who lives there would prefer to have all the apples for themselves.nNotes: I doubt that the current residents have a problem with gleaners because there are now more apples scattered around both trees then there are apples on the tree now! These trees are both semi-dwarf and are prominent in the front yard, right at the street's edge. The apple variety is unknonw, but they are small to medium sized red & green streaked fruits which are crisp, tangy and very juicy similar to Fuji's..perfect for fresh eating, adding to a cider mix, or dehydration.
